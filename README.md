I am currently pursuing a master's in computer science with a specialization in Machine Learning at George Mason University. I will be graduating in May 2023 and am actively seeking opportunities in software development or machine learning.

My motto is "Trying to improve the society we live in. Believe in technology to derive change. Ideas work when we do." I am passionate about using technology to solve practical problems and believe in its potential to make a positive impact on people's lives worldwide.

Here are a few things I've learned about myself through my personal and professional experiences:
 ◦ I enjoy coding and solving problems, and I am deeply interested in resolving the never-ending 
 the conundrum of software engineering.
 ◦ I focus on delivering key outcomes, working with amazing people, and quickly adapting to new 
 learnings to create, scale, and optimize solutions that matter to stakeholders.
 ◦ I prioritize the requirements of my clients and customers in all that I do.
 ◦ I excel at executing big ideas within given limits and am a great storyteller, making amazing 
 presentations to communicate my ideas and insights.
 ◦ While my intuition is strong, I base my judgments on evidence and numbers.

I continually educate, refine, and drive myself to be a better person, and I am always learning and adapting to new challenges. I maintain my composure in the face of adversity and focus on making high-quality decisions. I take pleasure in expanding my network and gaining insights from diverse perspectives. Whether it's to discuss emerging technologies, software development, machine learning, or even basketball, I welcome the opportunity to connect and engage in meaningful discussions. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
